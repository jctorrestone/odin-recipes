        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Lasagna is a flat and expanded pasta sheet, traditionally made in Italy with Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese), Béchamel sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce). 
            Despite the traditional form still being popular, lasagna has taken on many different recipes over the years. 
            The dish is made by stacking lasagna sheets on top of each other with meats, vegetables, cheeses, and tomato sauce between. It is then baked before being served.
